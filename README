This project is a collaboration around http://pkedu.fbt.wur.nl/~koos/jQueryTextAnnotator/ where Koos is trying to integratie with Drupal.

The first goal is to grasp features as in "is this possible with features"

When a stable module exists the module will probably get part of http://drupal.org/project/annotate which is related to but not as cool as this yellow marker stuff aka text annotator.

As features are depending on modules here a short list of modules needed.

1. cck providing nodereference
2. features
3. views
4. views_datasource provinding views_json
